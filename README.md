## Description

[Elsa Health](https://elsa.health) Child milestones and wellness tracker is a simple online tool to help parents and guardians track the milestone development of their children (or children in their care).

The intentions behind these assessment tools are to support decision making for care providers and guardians as well as provide a framework for easily identifying when children are failing to meet their milestones.

[Elsa Health](https://elsa.health) as an organization is commited to <b>equal access</b> to healthcare for all. We do this the best way we know how, by building technologies to augment the capacity and skills of decision makers (healthcare workers, governments, researchrs, parents, guardians, and individuals) to support optimal decision making. _Disease should be a thing of the past_
